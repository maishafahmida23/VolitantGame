🔹 Main Features
1. Login Screen – MainActivity
Consists of username and password input fields.

Two buttons:

Login → Opens the Dashboard directly.

First name, Last name, Username, Password

Clicking “Sign Up” takes the user to the Dashboard.

Back button icon is present but not yet functional.

3. Dashboard – dashboard
Main functionality panel post-login/signup.

Three primary buttons:

SOS! (Visually emphasized; actual functionality not coded yet — potential feature: trigger SMS or call)

Emergency Contacts → Opens contacts screen.

Helpline numbers (No action coded yet — can later lead to a helpline list or dialer).

4. Contacts – contacts
Displays a title: “Your Emergency Contacts”.

Background image applied for design.

Currently static — no actual list of contacts yet.

🎨 UI Design:
Uses RelativeLayouts and hardcoded margins.

ImageView as background for all screens (@drawable/faded).

Color-coded buttons and text views for readability.

Consistent font style (serif) and text coloring.
